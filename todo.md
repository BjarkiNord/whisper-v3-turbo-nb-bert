Experimented with using nb-bert as the sole comparison between the predicted string from the model and the truth value, using cosine similarity. 

Plan to test if a combination of WER/CER and nb-bert could work better, or whether to use nb-bert if the WER/CER hit a certain treshhold as it might be able to give a better indicator of similarity between the two strings.
